An Introduction to Scala Futures
-------------

* A Future a reference to the result of an asynchronous computation. In other words, a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in future, as a result of some concurrent computation.

Key points in this tutorial:

1. How to create Futures
2. How to define Callbacks on Futures (non-blocking result retrieval)
3. How Futures work with For-Comprehensions
4. Accessing the result Scala Futures using Await (blocking result retrieval). Specifying Duration
5. Chaining Futures with partial functions; Ordering Futures
6. Completing a Future using Promises
